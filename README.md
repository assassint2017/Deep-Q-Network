# Deep-Q-Network
using DQN play games in OpenAI gym

**Deep reinforcement learning** has received more and more attention. **Deep q network** is the beginning of DRL. Therefore, for those who want to enter the field of deep reinforcement learning, I hope that my code can help you better understand DQN algorithm and **openai-gym** environment.

I use pytorch to implement the **original dqn** and its two variants: **dueling dqn** and **double dqn**. When doing the **cartpole** game, I observed these two variants, especially the dueling dqn is better than the original dqn.
